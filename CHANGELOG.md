# Changelog

## [0.2.3+tinlion.1] — 2026-05-16

Tin Lion Ventures fork — `tin-lion-ventures/slack-toolkit`.

### Added
- Per-profile environment-variable resolution for bot and user tokens in `slack_cli/config.py`. New environment-variable names follow the pattern `SLACK_<PROFILE_UPPER>_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_<PROFILE_UPPER>_USER_TOKEN`. The per-profile variable takes priority over the existing global `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (preserved) and the profile-file `bot_token` field (also preserved).
- `require_profile()` error message now names the expected per-profile variable and gives an `op read` invocation example for operators using a secret manager.
- Seven unit tests in `tests/test_per_profile_env.py` covering the priority order and the naming-guidance error path.

### Changed
- Version string suffixed `+tinlion.1` (PEP 440 local-version) so fork installs are identifiable from `slack-cli --version` and PyPI upgrades do not silently overwrite the fork.

### Rationale
Enables no-disk-persistence credential setups — tokens live in a secret manager (1Password Teams via the `op` CLI in our case) and are read into the process at invocation time rather than persisted to `~/.slack-cli.json`. Upstream behaviour is preserved end-to-end; users who prefer the disk-persistence pattern see no change.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Rewrote all 33 skill descriptions for better model selection:
  - Descriptions stay under 230 chars (avoids 252-char truncation in model context windows)
  - Front-loaded trigger phrases for more accurate skill matching
  - Added NOT-clauses to disambiguate overlapping skills (post/schedule, post/block-kit, post/thread, api-expert/dynamic/troubleshooting)
  - CoD-inspired density: informative but concise
